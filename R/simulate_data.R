# 2. alternatively, you can simulate the distribution of occurrence points by
# simulating locations, biased by the *product* of the bias and probability of
# detection in each cell. The probability of detection is calculated using a
# formula that assumes the occurrence comes from a catch (like the simulations
# above), and that the number of mosquitoes caught is a Poisson sample, given
# the average number. It is the probability of observing one *or more*
# mosquitoes in the catch.
