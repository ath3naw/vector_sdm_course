Encourage using the slack for asking and answering each others' questions.

Use live coding rather than slides (except initial concepts)

Provide pre-compelted code, that they can modify.

Develop exercises that require them to modify existing code - have stretch exercises on hand for people who finish early



day 1

part 1:
icebreaker/welcome

slides taking about concepts

part 2:

- use `terra` instead of `raster`

generating fake data
 - model for 'relative abundance' = loglinear
  - prep functions to make true relative abundance map from covariates (and scale the output)
 - simulating data
  - adding in planned surveys (model catch size from abundance)
  - adding in occurrence data (point process wth thinning based on bias)
      - give them a bias map (based on population density, travel time, and other things)
      - make them compute a probability of detection with a given effort, then thin this

day 2

try out different methods for accounting for bias from occurrence data:
fix to logistic regression

 - none; random background points, treat as unbiased
  - talk through process of preparing covariates, data, generating BG points, fitting logstic regression, predicting to a raster
  - talk about interpretation of the output map - is it a probabilities

 - different validation/exploration:
    - plot partial response curves, relative influence
    - compute AUC against biased data
    - compute AUC/correlation against true abundance data

 - Better methods
  - TGB
  - maxent with/without bias (use maxnet package, not maxent) - work out how to incorporate bias layer into maxent via maxnet
  - Fithian model, with the planned surveys added in
      (we should maybe demonstrate that with very biased planned catches, env gradient isn't sampled and it's still biased) (work out whether to incorporate bias into planned surveys - GR - stretch goal for how to incorporate) `multispeciesPP` package

day 3

part 1:

recap: rerun analysis with more complex fake data and best model from before?

talk about identifiability (total, and partial, ie. correlated covariates) - find climate data eg worldclim to demonstrate, eg altitude and temperature

split into groups to look at different things - e.g. try out pre-filtering covariates

part 2:

BYO problems, or running on real data

prep tasks:

- get covariates for kenya - AB (worldclim pkg or via raster / terra?)
- use terra:: to prepare them
- write code to sim some data - NG to prep example code, tidy later
- create fake bias map - write function to create from eg pop density - do that with stuff from malariaAtlas pkg - GR
- work out code for:
	- logistic regression model
	- tgb - make fake similar species with simlarish bias
	 - sampled from bias layer only
	 - sampled from bias plus covariates
	- maxent
	- fithian + bias in surveys
	- partial response curve (code / functions to do this)
	- auc v bias
	- auc v real
